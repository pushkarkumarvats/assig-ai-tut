### Render Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Push to GitHub (If not already done)
```bash
# If you haven't pushed to GitHub yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/career-recommender.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Check:** Verify your repository is visible at GitHub

#### Step 2: Create Render Account
1. Go to: https://render.com
2. Click "Get Started for Free"
3. Sign up with your GitHub account
4. Authorize Render to access your repositories

#### Step 3: Deploy on Render (Automatic)
1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click **"New +"** in the top right
3. Select **"Blueprint"**
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
6. Click **"Apply"**
7. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

**Expected Output:**
```
==> Building...
==> Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
==> Build successful in 3m 45s
==> Starting service...
==> Your service is live!
```

#### Step 4: Get Your API URL

Your API will be available at:
```
