## 1. Data Engineering & Feature Development

### 1.1 Feature Engineering Strategy

**Decision**: Implement hierarchical feature engineering with skill clusters, interest profiles, and interaction features.

**Rationale**:
- Raw skills and interests are text-based and high-dimensional
- Clustering similar attributes reduces dimensionality while preserving information
- Interaction features capture non-linear relationships between attributes
- Domain-specific features (e.g., technical vs. soft skills) align with career requirements

**Implementation**:
- **Skill Clusters**: Technical skills vs. soft skills categorization
- **Interest Profiles**: Tech, creative, business, and social-oriented scores
- **Personality Features**: Normalized scores with derived balance metrics
- **Interaction Features**: Cross-product features (e.g., analytical × technical skills)
- **Composite Features**: Career readiness score combining multiple factors

**Impact**: Created 24 meaningful features from raw data, enabling model to learn complex patterns.

### 1.2 Personality Trait Normalization

**Decision**: Use StandardScaler for personality traits instead of keeping raw [0,1] scores.

**Rationale**:
- Standardization ensures personality traits have similar scale to other features
- Helps gradient-based models converge faster
- Preserves relative differences while normalizing distribution

**Alternative Considered**: Min-Max scaling (kept raw [0,1] range)
- **Why Not Chosen**: StandardScaler provides better numerical stability for tree-based models

### 1.3 Class Imbalance Handling

**Decision**: Document class imbalance but do not apply synthetic oversampling during training.

**Rationale**:
- Multi-label classification makes traditional oversampling complex
- Class imbalance is inherent to career distribution (some careers are genuinely more common)
- Model performance metrics account for imbalance (Hamming loss, label ranking)
- Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) are relatively robust to class imbalance

**Alternative Considered**: SMOTE or RandomOverSampler
- **Why Not Chosen**: Risk of overfitting on synthetic data; real-world career distribution should be reflected

---

## 2. Multi-Label Career Prediction Model

### 2.1 Algorithm Selection

**Decision**: Compare Random Forest and XGBoost with MultiOutputClassifier wrapper.

**Rationale**:

**Random Forest**:
- ✅ Excellent for tabular data
- ✅ Handles non-linear relationships well
- ✅ Feature importance readily available
- ✅ Robust to outliers
- ⚠️ Can be slower for large datasets

**XGBoost**:
- ✅ State-of-art performance on structured data
- ✅ Regularization prevents overfitting
- ✅ Efficient gradient boosting
- ⚠️ Requires more careful hyperparameter tuning

**MultiOutputClassifier Wrapper**:
- Enables multi-label classification by training one classifier per label
- Maintains independence between career predictions
- Parallelizable for efficiency

**Alternative Considered**: Neural Networks (Multi-label output layer)
- **Why Not Chosen**: Requires more data; tree-based models excel on tabular data; interpretability

### 2.2 Hyperparameter Optimization

**Decision**: Use manual hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation insights.

**Rationale**:
- Grid search on multi-label problems is computationally expensive
- Selected parameters based on best practices and iterative testing
- Focus on key parameters: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`

**Random Forest Parameters**:
```python
{
    'n_estimators': 200,
    'max_depth': 20,
    'min_samples_split': 2,
    'min_samples_leaf': 1,
    'max_features': 'sqrt'
}
```

**XGBoost Parameters**:
```python
{
    'n_estimators': 200,
    'max_depth': 6,
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8
}
```

**Alternative Considered**: Bayesian Optimization or Optuna
- **Why Not Chosen**: Time constraints; manual tuning provided strong baseline performance

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics

**Decision**: Use multi-label specific metrics: Hamming Loss, Label Ranking Average Precision, Precision@k.

**Rationale**:

**Hamming Loss**: 
- Measures average per-label classification error
- Lower is better; <0.15 indicates strong performance

**Label Ranking Average Precision (LRAP)**:
- Evaluates ranking quality of predicted labels
- Critical for recommendation systems
- >0.85 indicates excellent ranking

**Precision@k (k=3)**:
- Measures accuracy of top-3 recommendations
- Directly aligns with user experience (users see top recommendations)
- >0.80 indicates reliable top predictions

**Subset Accuracy**:
- Exact match accuracy (all labels correct)
- Strict metric; lower values expected in multi-label tasks

**Why Not Standard Metrics**: Traditional accuracy misleading for multi-label; need ranking-aware metrics

## 3. Confidence Score Engineering

### 3.1 Hybrid Scoring System

**Decision**: Combine model probabilities (70%) with feature-based heuristics (30%).

**Rationale**:
- **Model probabilities**: Data-driven predictions from learned patterns
- **Feature-based heuristics**: Domain knowledge about career requirements
- 70/30 split balances data-driven and rule-based approaches
- Heuristics handle edge cases where model may lack training data

**Heuristic Components**:
1. **Skill Match Score**: Overlap between user skills and career requirements
2. **Technical Skills Requirement**: Minimum technical skills for tech careers
3. **Personality Match**: Alignment of personality traits with career profiles
4. **Education Requirement**: Minimum education level for each career

**Alternative Considered**: Pure model probabilities
- **Why Not Chosen**: Model may lack domain knowledge for rare combinations; heuristics improve reliability

### 3.2 Rule-Based Adjustments

**Decision**: Apply domain-specific rules to adjust confidence scores.

**Rationale**:
- Boost technical careers for experienced candidates with technical skills
- Penalize technical careers for candidates without any technical skills
- Boost creative careers for highly creative personalities
- Boost management careers for candidates with leadership skills

**Example Rules**:
```python
# Rule: Boost for high experience in technical careers
if career in ['Data Scientist', 'Software Engineer'] and experience >= 5:
    score *= 1.1  # 10% boost

# Rule: Penalize technical careers without technical skills
if career in ['Data Scientist', 'Software Engineer'] and tech_skills == 0:
    score *= 0.5  # 50% penalty
```

**Impact**: Improves recommendation quality for edge cases; prevents nonsensical recommendations

### 3.3 Score Normalization

**Decision**: Normalize top-k recommendations to sum to 100%.

**Rationale**:
- User-friendly percentage interpretation
- Ensures confidence scores are relative to current predictions
- Makes recommendations comparable across different user profiles

**Alternative Considered**: Raw probabilities
- **Why Not Chosen**: Raw probabilities may not sum to 100%; less intuitive for users

### 3.4 Confidence Validation Framework

**Decision**: Validate confidence scores using top-k accuracy and confidence separation metrics.

**Rationale**:
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: Measures if highest confidence prediction is correct
- **Top-3 Accuracy**: Measures if any of top-3 predictions are correct (user-centric)
- **Confidence Separation**: Measures if correct predictions have higher confidence than incorrect ones
- Validation ensures confidence scores are meaningful and calibrated

**Target Metrics**:
- Top-1 Accuracy: >0.5
- Top-3 Accuracy: >0.8
- Confidence Separation: >10 percentage points

- Education: Enum of valid levels
- Experience: Integer in [0, 50]

### 4.3 Model Versioning

**Decision**: Include model version in response and support version-based loading.

**Rationale**:
- Enables tracking predictions to specific model versions
- Facilitates A/B testing and gradual rollouts
- Debugging and auditing capabilities
- Future-proof for multiple model versions

**Implementation**:
```python
{
    "model": trained_model,
    "model_name": "random_forest",
    "career_names": [...],
    "version": "1.0"
}
```

### 4.4 Error Handling

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.

**Rationale**:
- 422: Validation errors (client-side issue)
- 500: Prediction errors (server-side issue)
- 503: Model not loaded (service unavailable)
- Clear error messages help API consumers debug issues
