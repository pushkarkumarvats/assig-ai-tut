# üöÄ Quick Deploy to Render - 5 Steps

## Before You Start
**YOU MUST TRAIN THE MODEL FIRST!** The model file needs to exist before deployment.

---

## Step 1: Train Model Locally (Required!)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open and run ALL cells in these notebooks:
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_engineering.ipynb
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_model_development.ipynb
```

**Verify the model file exists:**
```bash
# Windows
dir models\career_recommender_v1.pkl

# Mac/Linux  
ls models/career_recommender_v1.pkl
```

‚úÖ If you see the file, proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files (model is now included!)
git add .
git commit -m "Career Recommendation Engine with trained model"

# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/career-recommender.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
